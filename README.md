## **About the project**	
- The project was developed with React framework (for the client side) and MVC architecture (for the server side).
The npm libraries which were installed in this project ware React-Router-v6 and  npm i --save @microsoft/signalr.
- You can download the project using the commang `git clone https://github.com/TOMER-77/ap2-ex2.git`
- To examine the server side you should enter the [ChatApplciation](https://github.com/TOMER-77/ap2-ex2/tree/main/ChatApplciation "ChatApplciation")  directory, and read the README instructions file inside the directory.
- To examine the client side you should enter the [clientSide](https://github.com/TOMER-77/ap2-ex2/tree/main/clientSide "clientSide") directory, and read the README instructions file inside the directory.

**It is important for us to mention that we assumed that username is a global identifier for a user or contact (as we were asked in the first exercise). Therefore, while trying to add a new contact, if the user already has a contact with the same username (but might be from a different server), the action will be failed.**
